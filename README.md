# Shopcrawl

## Overview
Shopcrawl enhances the online shopping experience by providing an advanced tool that computes the marginal benefit (MB) and cost-benefit (CB) analysis for products across multiple e-commerce platforms. This tool helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions by evaluating factors such as price, shipping costs, consumer ratings, and more through real-time data scraping.

# Problem Statement
In the dynamic world of online shopping, consumers frequently struggle to determine the optimal purchasing venue for products due to variations in pricing, shipping costs, consumer ratings, and payment options across platforms. Shopcrawl addresses this challenge by scraping data directly from these platforms, providing a robust MB and CB analysis to guide consumer choices.

# How It Works
### Data Retrieval
Initiates a data scraping sequence across selected e-commerce sites upon receiving a user's search query.

### Data Indexing
Indexes the scraped data in a structured temporary database for efficient retrieval and comparison.

### Analysis Application
Applies MB and CB calculations to the indexed data to assess each productâ€™s overall value.

### Result Ranking
Ranks products based on the analysis and user preferences, ensuring the most beneficial options are highlighted.

## Features
